# Laptop-Price-Analysis-
Laptop Price Prediction Model using various machine learning algorithms. This project explores different features of laptops and predicts their price based on specifications like RAM, CPU, GPU, Screen Resolution, Storage, and more.

Data Preprocessing: I handled missing values, cleaned data, and transformed categorical features using one-hot encoding.

Feature Engineering: Extracted key features such as touchscreen, IPS screen, and computed PPI (Pixel Per Inch) based on screen resolution and size.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data to identify patterns and relationships, leading to better feature selection.

Model Building: Compared several regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, Decision Trees, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest, to predict laptop prices.

Model Evaluation: Used metrics like RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.

# ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries:
Machine Learning: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Web Development: Flask, HTML
Evaluation Metrics: RÂ² Score, MAE

# ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:
This project helped me better understand the power of machine learning in predicting prices and optimizing product sales, especially in e-commerce.
